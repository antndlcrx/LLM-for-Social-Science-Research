"The provided text does not contain variables named like \"Q1\", \"Q2\", etc.,  as specified in your instructions.  The text describes variables with names like `I_RELIGPRAC`, `DISBELIEF`, `I_NORM1`, etc., and their calculation methods based on other variables (often prefixed with 'F' or 'E').  There are no response categories listed in a format that maps numerical values to string labels.  Therefore, I cannot create the JSON output you requested.\n\nTo generate the JSON, I need a codebook that provides:\n\n1. **Variable Names:**  Variable names following the \"Q[number]\" pattern.\n2. **Categories:**  A mapping of numerical codes to descriptive labels for each variable.  This should be explicitly stated in the codebook, not inferred from formulas.\n3. **Descriptions:** A textual description of what each variable measures.\n4. **Questions/Statements:** The exact wording of the question or statement presented to respondents for each variable.\n\n\n**Example of the required input:**\n\n\nQ1  Importance of Family\n    1: Very important\n    2: Rather important\n    3: Not very important\n    4: Not at all important\n    -1: Don't know\n    -2: No answer\ndescription: Importance of family in respondent's life.\nquestion: \"How important is family in your life?  (1=Very important, 4=Not at all important)\"\n\nQ2  Political Affiliation\n    1: Democrat\n    2: Republican\n    3: Independent\n    -1: Refused to answer\ndescription: Respondent's political party affiliation.\nquestion: \"Which political party do you identify with?\"\n\n\nWith this kind of input, I can produce the JSON output you specified.  Please provide a codebook with the necessary information in a similar format."
